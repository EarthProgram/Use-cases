![Use Case Diagram](/images/EarthProgramUseCases.png)

## UC1 Self-sovereign identity for all

Identity is the new currency and the youth need to have control over theirs.

Many people do not yet understand the power of their identity, especially the youth. Tsholofelo is a young, unemployed South African woman who is struggling to find a job because she doesn’t have any form of identification that her employers can use to run a background check on her. She signs up to Green Yoma on the advice of her friend, where she is able to create a self-attested identity for herself. Tsholofelo is now able to unlock opportunities to upskill herself, possible employment opportunities as well as opportunities to work for the betterment of her society and be rewarded for it, for example, participating in community upliftment programmes that are listed online.

## UC2 Incentivizing Youth to Change their World

Giving youth the agency and rewards to make a difference in their communities.

Musafa lives in a very dry and arid region of Egypt. Where he lives, the soil has been eroded and all that’s left is hard, sun-baked sand and dust. Musafa sees an opportunity on Green Yoma for him to be rewarded if he takes part in the “Reforestation Challenge.” Musafa takes a picture of his local village before he gets started and then works to turn the soil and plant some small, hardy shrubs. Once he is done he uploads a picture of his hard work to Green Yoma. From there, an independent verifier verifies that Musafa has successfully completed the challenge and is rewarded with a universal token, in this case, a carbon offset certificate, which he can use on various global marketplaces. 

## UC3 Building Supply in the Impact Marketplace

Tim is an impact investor. However, he finds the current process of sharing, managing, and verifying the completion of impact challenges to be arduous and complex. Beyond this, finding a relevant and up-to-date impact marketplace is proving difficult. Tim reads about Green Yoma, where he can choose to list his own impact opportunities, with their own set of completion criteria. Here he sets the parameters, the incentives and the timelines. By making use of an independent verifying tool, once users have completed the task and been verified, they will be rewarded automatically, which cuts out a lot of admin for Tim.

## UC4 Investing for Impact

While browsing Green Yoma, Tim has come across a few impact opportunities that really appeal to him. Clicking through the various options, Tim is able to see all the details about the opportunities and decides that he would like to get involved in the reforestation challenge in Egypt. While he is not the creator or convener for this opportunity, Tim is able to contribute to the overall rewards and incentives of this opportunity as part of being an Impact Investor. Tim is able to track the progress of the opportunity to ensue that his investment has indeed made a difference.
## UC5 Hungry Lisbon Traveller

Grace is an advisor to different community currency groups. She has a Circles and a SEEDS wallet and some Sarafu. While in Lisbon, she is looking for a restaurant that accepts community currencies. She uses the Open Street Maps to identify a restaurant which accepts community currency, in this case chiemgauer. Her wallet allows her to convert Circles to chiemgauer and buy a meal for herself and a colleague.
## UC6 Circles Clearinghouse

Nina owns a restaurant which accepts eusco in Basque country. Travellers from other countries have paid her in Circles. Nina has purchased a new coffee machine from a German manufacturer. A credit clearing house app allows her to simply debit those Circles and have the invoice from the manufacturer receive the payment for the purchase in Euros which are converted transparently through the Circles network. 

## UC7 Impact Knowledge Sharing and Communication

Shang-Chi, a Hong Kong social enterprise manager needs an online platform for the purpose of broadcasting his social project’s impact to stakeholders (funders/investors/partners/beneficiaries), which includes sharing their success stories and promoting co-learning with their peers in the same sector. The manager creates an account and log-in the platform to create a project Impact Profile. He adds symbolic photos and texts to the profile to tell the impact story of the project, a diagram of Theory of Change, and then embeds an impact dashboard that shows real-time output/outcome data he collected through survey monkey over the course of the project. The impact profile is then shared with stakeholders for the purpose of communicating the project’s progress on making impact (based on a visualized and evidence-based impact story).

## UC8 Impact Accountability and Data Validation

A Hong Kong social enterprise manager needs to ensure the organization’s impact accountability to its funder. The data (reported by the beneficiaries) against the intended outcomes need to be validated. The manager uses a platform that allows him to ensure the authenticity of the data submitted by the beneficiary and know the time and date of the data submission. The manager also validates the credibility of the outcome data based on external evidence (e.g. photos, documents). Having all this information associated with the data, the manager then approves each submission record by signing on it (digitally). These validated data are incorporated into the reports to funder, which are auditable, accountable, and traceable. 

## UC9 Carbon Data Record

Record data on blockchain, including Carbon Source, Carbon Sink, calculations and listing price.
Company A has more carbon sinks than itself needs. So Company A decided to see if any other companies need these “carbon emission rights”. Company A find a verifier to verifies theirs carbon sinks and record all the related data including the type, amount, etc. 

## UC10 Carbon Asset Marketplace

Companies can buy carbon assets according to their requirements.
Company A lists the carbon sink data on the marketplace with price. Company B is a manufacturer and estimated that it will emit more than its allocation by the end of the year. Company B looks for favorite counterparties on the marketplace and found that Company A’s carbon sink meet perfectly with their needs and they came into agreement by OTC on the carbon marketplace. 

## UC11 Remediation Financing
Carbon credit can be assessed based on the record on blockchain; companies can apply for financing based on carbon credit.

## UC12 Global Impact through Renewable Energy Certificates

Rosemarie is the director of the International Climate Change Authority (UNFCCC)’s new 2022 Renewable Energy Certificate program. Rosemarie uses the Interchain Earth Program to operationalize a system for vetting and verifying the creation of new sources of renewable energy by semi-automating the creation of non-fungible tokens called REC2022 impact tokens. Working with her technical team, Rosemarie establishes a framework for renewable projects to first qualify for funding according to specific rules, then earn REC2022 tokens by getting their actual electrical production audited and verified. Rosemarie also recruits both funding sources and potential renewable energy producers to use the new framework. The result is a global system of highly scalable financing and realization of new renewable energy sources.

## UC13 Qualified Impact

Nathan is a newly authorized project certifier for REC2022 proposals. He is randomly selected for the first opportunity to review a project proposal from HydroElec. He scans the proposal and accepts the opportunity, then begins his formal review. He checks that the proposal contains all of the required sections and that each section addresses all of the requirements of the REC2022 framework. Unfortunately, the first version of the proposal is missing a key section about the make and model of HydroElec’s smart meters. He reaches out to HydroElect, informs them of the problem and suggests they update the proposal and resubmit, with a reference to their first proposal to ensure that Nathan continues the certification. After HydroElect submits a new, signed proposal, Nathan repeats his review and finds the project satisfies all the criteria. He then issues a signed credential formally attesting to his findings and gives that to HydroElect. The credential references the original proposal using a machine-verifiable identifier to ensure the authenticity of the certification.

## UC14 Making Money Making Clean Energy

Helen is the CEO of HydroElec, a hydroelectric producer in Kenya building a new dam. As part of the financial planning for the project, she developed a formal proposal to use the UN’s new REC2022 standard for minting renewable energy certificate NFTs. After submitting the proposal to the UN, she worked with a certifier to demonstrate the project meets all of the goals of the program. With that certification, she was able to secure funding and built the project. 

As the operation generates electricity, it’s smart meters automatically generate verifiable credentials attesting to the actual kWh produced every day.

Once operational, Helen finds a verification agent, Lynn, who was able to inspect the operations and verify that the new project is operating according to the proposal and UN guidelines, issuing a credential authorizing HydroElec to issue REC2022 tokens when providing evidence issued by their smart meters and attested to by HydroElect. Every day, upon production of the evidentiary verifiable credentials, Helen’s team triggers the minting of new NFTs by submitting a token mint transaction with all of the relevant information: the original proposal, its certification, the verification audit results, the smart meters’ production credentials, and HydroElects legal attestation that this evidence is accurate and meets the requirements of REC2022. Helen can now sell those REC2022 tokens on the market at the time of her choosing to any party interested in renewable energy certificates. Those buyers can retire those certificates to claim the environmental benefit of using renewable energy.

## UC15 Verified Impact

Lynn is a verification agent for REC2022. She is called by HydroElec to audit their new production facility. After reviewing the certified proposal, she visits the HydroElec site to inspect and verify both the capacity of the system under operating conditions and the security of the automated smart meters. She uses a standard set of criteria established by the UN to record her observations and make a determination about the project’s compliance with both its certified proposal and UN requirements. After finding everything in order, Lynn issues a verification credential with a six month expiry and a maximum capacity of 20 billion kWh, which she gives to HydroElec. The credential references both the original proposal and its certification using machine-verifiable identifiers to ensure the authenticity of the verification.


# Focal Use Cases

## Background

As pressure mounts to balance the yearly global carbon budget due to increasing risk to life, property and markets due to climate related.

Carbon accounting, markets and politics. Long lobbied by scientists and citizen groups, corporations and governments are finally taking climate related risk seriously. As voluntary and compliance markets for carbon, corporate science based reporting, emissions taxes and other mechanisms become more common, the demands for carbon accounting integrity become more challenging to meet.

Carbon accounting and science: Carbon accounting should follow the natural carbon cycle. Emissions (respiration) and sequestration (inspiration). The global carbon budget must not simply be brought to net zero as quickly as possible, it must also achieve a carbon negative balance for some time to bring us back to pre-industrial levels if we want to guarantee conditions conducive to biosphere functioning as humans have evolved.

There are three major types of carbon credits.

**Avoided emissions** -- a factory spent money to increase efficiency and can claim credits as they reduce emissions). 

**Renewable Energy Credits** -- a city shifts from fossil fuel based energy to renewable energy and claims credits associated with the quantification of carbon emissions reduction

**Natural carbon or “living carbon”** -- Encapsulated by “terraculture” and “mariculture” (AFOLU: Agriculture, Forestry and other Land Use) and Blue Carbon in which sequestration and/or maintenance of carbon stocks in living systems is monitored and quantified.

## Scenario
Acme Ag and their ecosystem of farmers, processors, and logistics providers, would like to meet the ambitious goals of carbon neutrality by 2030, and even explore if providing carbon credits to industries that cannot hope to achieve carbon negative operations (such as the energy sector, could become a long term profit center.

Acme Ag wants to be able to have accurate carbon reporting internally, as well as participate in markets to buy and sell carbon credits to ensure year over year they can meet carbon accounting goals 1st and position themselves to be a provider of carbon to the market they believe is coming, in partnership with their farmers.

Farmer Jane provides produce to Acme Ag. She would like to add carbon credit sales to her list of produce. In addition to Acme there are also several other marketplaces forming and Jane wants to be able to find the best possible price for her carbon with the least amount of work.

A start up carbon market (Market1) approaches her with an easy monitoring and verification onboarding scheme and upfront payment in exchange for her carbon. She accepts because she needs the cash. Market1 is running as a smart contract in an Ethereum state channel.

Acme Ag partners with a second marketplace (Market2) which has a higher price, and a different and more rigorous verification threshold. Jane second guesses her decision and registers on Market2 as well as Market1.

The first round of carbon credits have already been issued. The transition of carbon from Market1 to Market2 requires running additional data collection and uses a different quantification algorithm that is considered by many to be more rigorous and has less uncertainty. Market2 is running on a cosmosSDK chain.

Acme Ag agrees to underwrite the cost of additional verification.

Acme Ag does not want Farmer Jane's geolocation to be public and desires that this data be kept private and only available to approved monitors and verifiers in the system because they are worried about a competing company poaching their high performing farmers


## Distinction / Challenge

### Additionality

> Who has the right to account for the carbon mitigation or sequestration

In some markets you must not only prove that the carbon was not emitted, but also that if you were not paid it WOULD have been emitted (I call this the carbon hostage approach to additionality). Multiple parties must be able to claim responsibility accurately and with integrity so that the right party(ies) has(ve) the right to claim the carbon.

### Permanence

> How long will this carbon be sequestered, or stored?

In living carbon claims permanence is variable dependent on conditions such as droughts (which force emissions) rainfall (which increases sequestration) that are beyond human control, as well as activities (land use practices) which are within human control. This creates complexity. It is essential to have global carbon buffer pools to cover permanence issues from both human causes and natural caused reduction of carbon stocks. This requires some fungibility.

### Leakage

> Does this change create a carbon emission increase somewhere else.

For instance does forest conservation in one place cause a forest somewhere else to be cut down? Ability to link credit claims to a larger system of carbon accounting (transport, etc) are important. Ability for counter claims are important.

### Uncertainty

> How sure are we about the monitoring and quantification methodology that is under the hood of the carbon credit in question.

There is always some uncertainty as this is a probabilistic science, especially with living carbon credits. Metadata associated with the evidence backing a credit, the specific threshold of “verification”, and clear statements of uncertainty are required.


## Artifacts

## Trust/Liability Hierarchy

1. Carbon Credit producers are liable for accurately claiming legitimate reduction in carbon.
2. Verifiers are liable for the quality of their verification.

## Threat Model
**Threat**: False carbone sequestration <br/>
**Threat**: Incorrect carbon meta-data (location, nature, etc.)</br>
